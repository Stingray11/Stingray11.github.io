Welcome! It might look more shabby compared to blogs from other blog services. But this website is actually hosted via GitHub for free. I used Markdown to type blog posts. If my understanding is correct, Jekyll compiles the post in markdown and convert them into html files to view.

Please use the above naviation bar to access blog post, documentations, and projects.

Since this is pretty much a Git project, I can do cool stuff with javascript like this: (try click below)
 <script src="page5.js" type="module"></script>
  <canvas id="flock" height="200px" width="600px" style="border:0px solid black"></canvas>
