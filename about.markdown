This is Stingray. I am currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University.

Here you can find a portfolio of my past projects and documentation for them.

I will also post some blogs about my life.

I would like to still keep myself anonymous. I enjoy privacy and don't want to get into trouble with my projects.
