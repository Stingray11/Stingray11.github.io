## Background

**IDEX Printers**

The name “IDEX” means Independent Dual Extrusion System where two extrusion heads are mounted on one y-axis but driven independently on the x-axis. This allows multi-material 3D printing while the inactive extruder can reside away from the printed part.

**My involvement in 3D printing**

I got my first 3D printer during high school. It was around 2015-16. Back then, the 3D printing hobbyist community is in its infancy. However, this meant that I got to witness the rapid development of 3D printing, specifically Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers. During my undergraduate, I also spent time on research on 3D printing composite materials. With this knowledge in mind, I gradually had a preference about what capabilities matter most to me. In August 2020, I finally had time to design a printer based on my understanding, knowledge, and preference. The first iteration of the printer is drastically different compared to the current version. Over the one-year period, I discovered aspects of designs that need to be improved. 
 
**Previous versions of IDEX**

In the first iteration of IDEX, I mounted the x-axis motors on the y-axis carriage. This caused excessive mass concentrated on the x-axis, resulting in a slower print speed. To reduce the weight of the y-axis carriage, I redesigned the kinematics of the printer, moving the x-axis motor stationary to the frame of the printer. 

The new kinematics uses many bearings on shafts to route the timing belt. However, the shafts were only supported at one end. Over time, the shafts started bending due to the tension on the belt. On the z-axis, I used polycarbonate (PC) to print a bracket and carbon fiber tubes to mount the print bed. However, the stiffness is still less optimal. 

Throughout the two previous iterations, I used a piezoelectric sensor mounted on the hot end. To properly mount the piezoelectric sensor, some amount of flex is required. The flex caused the hot end to wobble during printing.

**What is purchased and what is designed**

It will be impossible to completely start from scratch with designing my own controller and implementing GCode library. The current controller available on the market is quite comprehensive. I chose the Duet3 mainboard due to its 6 stepper motor controller, powerful expandability, and ease of configure. I also sourced and spec the stepper motor and linear rails. The extruder I selected for this third upgrade is Biqu H2. This new extruder is extremely compact and light while being a direct drive extruder. Direct drive refers to the motor being mounted directly connected to the hot end. This allows a very short filament path from the extrusion gears to the nozzle. Everything else, mostly 3D printed parts, was designed by me. One of the motivations for me to design my own 3D printer is that the available designs don’t satisfy my own needs. And it is a proud moment to say that I DESIGNED this printer and put my badge on top of it. 
 
## Update Log

**Note: pictures related to fabrication steps were labeled with (Fabrication #)**

**Extruder**

The new extruder I choose is Biqu H2 for its compactness and lightness. The cooling fan for the hot end is integrated with the extruder assembly. To accommodate the new extruder, the mount also needs to be completely redesigned.

**XY-axis**

The XY axis is mounted on the frame and can be considered as a combined system. The design had been completely overhauled compared to the previous version. Specifically, the end bracket on the end of the y-axis had an improved tensioner. The tensioner uses 4 screws to allow manual tension of the x-axis timing belt. Previously there was a 90 deg turn at the belt tensioner, now it's in line with the direction of the belt. 

The y-axis mount also included support for both the top and bottom end of the shaft, further reducing the amount of flex on the shaft. 

The y-axis motor has been moved from the front to the back end of the frame. In addition, the number of motors had been reduced to one to further reduce the complexity of the y-axis design.

**Z-axis**

The previous PC parts started to crack due to the high tension on the axis. Using two linear rails also caused the platform to tilt often. I made two sheet metal parts using a sheet metal brake from harbor freight. I also designed a pair of new 90 deg brackets to connect the sheet metal part with the base plate of the bed.

**Assisted bed leveling**

One of the most useful features in this upgrade is the assisted bed leveling system. Previously I had been frustrated with the Piezoelectric sensor as my heated bed is not stiff enough to guarantee a good trigger when probing. In this upgrade, I added 4 limit switches around the bed. They are wired in series and normally closed such that once one is triggered, the circuit is open. This new design increased the reliability of bed probing greatly.

**LED cover**

In the first project of this semester, I experimented with bending acrylic sheets with an acrylic bender. I used the same technique for this new LED cover.

**Electronics compartment**

I added panels around the electronics compartment. These panels were printed with no top/bottom layers, exposing the triangular infill structure to allow air to be vented into the electronics compartment.
