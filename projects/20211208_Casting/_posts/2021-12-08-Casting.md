## Mold design
The geometry of the grip I designed is quite simple, with no sharp edges, mostly smooth curves. However, to accommodate the wrench, a slot needs to be casted into the grip such that after casting the wrench can be fitted in. Also, geometry wise, the grip is pretty small. I thought about better replacement for the foam core/acrylic temporary container used for casting shown in the introduction videos. I went to IKEA and bought small plastic container that is slightly bigger than the grip. Compared to casting the top mold first approach, with the small plastic container, I can simply pour in half of the silicone, wait it to solidify, and then pour in the top silicone. This eliminates the use of white clay completely which should simplify the process greatly. In order to hold the grip in place during the silicone pouring, I designed and 3D printed a small bracket to hold a 1/16 inch thick aluminum bar. Just in case the approach mentioned above didn’t work, I also made a traditional mold using the white clay approach.

## Mold Making
I used soldering iron to cut a slot on the wall of the small plastic container. Then I used double sided tape to glue the 3D printed bracket onto the side of the container. With the bracket in place, I can then insert in the aluminum bar and the clay grip. I thoroughly sprayed mold releases on the plastic box and the clay mold, marked the fill line, and poured in the silicone. After the first half of the silicone cured, I again sprayed some mold release and poured in the rest. 

I think there might be some misconceptions of my effort, here I included a short Q&A section:

Q: Why no divots on the mold?

A: Since the silicone shrinks during curing, the surface tension of the silicone gradually creates curves around the circumference of the mold, automatically aligns the top and bottom half of the mold. 

Q: Why not use acrylic/foam core?

A: Mostly due to the small size of my grip. In addition, using a plastic container allowed me to make a mold with thinner wall. Saving some silicon, towards the end of the project, there is a silicone shortage, I guess someone needs to thank me for using less silicone. 

Q: Why not use white clay?

A: I want to preserve my clay model as best I could. 

Q: I want to take points off because you didn’t make a traditional mold

A: I DID also make a traditional mold for backup if the plastic container approach didn’t work. But the silicone shortages prevented me from doing that.

## Casting
Prior to casting, I used a section of metal straw to cut a hole on the top of the mold. Then I sprayed mold release on the mold and aluminum bar. I then proceed with mixing the resin and casting the first part. For the first cast, I wasn’t super prepared and confident, which ended up waiting too long. Even before I completed pouring the resin in, it already started to solidify. I waited the next day and found out there is a big hole on the top of the cast. 
For the second attempt, I felt more confident with the procedures. However, after it had solidified, I found out that I sticked the funnel too deep into the mold, resulting in a little circular impression of the funnel on the top of the cast. There are some small air bubbles around the top surface of the part. I also experimented with sanding the part and testing the surface finish. 

With the lessons learned from the previous two castings, I proceeded with the third casting. I used the pressure vessel for the third casting. After curing, the third casting turned out to be much better in quality compared to previous ones. I felt confident that this will be final casting. For sanding, I started with 120 grid papers, then gradually progressed to 1000 grid. The final part is smooth to the touch with a nice surface finish. I ended up not painting it because I think the matte white surface looks pretty nice already.
